BerliFlow: Interactive Berlin Traffic Visualization Dashboard

üö¶ Project Overview
BerliFlow bridges the gap between Berlin‚Äôs fragmented traffic data sources and the need for actionable, accessible urban mobility insights. By integrating Berlin‚Äôs traffic APIs, OpenStreetMap geodata, and modern big data principles, we provide a user-friendly dashboard that transforms complex traffic data into meaningful visualizations.

Key Technologies:

MongoDB (optimized for JSON / GeoJSON and geospatial queries)

Python (pandas, geopandas, shapely for processing)

Streamlit (interactive web-based dashboard)

Containerized Cloud Deployment (CapRover)

üõë Problem Statement & Motivation
Berlin‚Äôs traffic data exists but is fragmented across city departments, published in technical formats that are not accessible to general users. Existing solutions lack integrated historical analysis or intuitive dashboards.
Challenges Addressed:

Accessibility: Non-technical users cannot easily interpret existing datasets.

Temporal Limitations: Existing tools lack robust historical exploration.

Decision-Making Gaps: Urban planners and officials lack consolidated, actionable insights.

Our Solution:
A unified platform offering real-time and historical traffic data visualization, enabling insights through interactive, map-based filtering and temporal exploration.

üß∞ Technology Stack
Component	Technology	Purpose
Backend	Python	Data integration, processing, APIs
Database	MongoDB	JSON & GeoJSON, flexible geospatial data
Frontend	Streamlit	Interactive dashboards & filtering
Geodata	OpenStreetMap	Base maps, district-level geometry
APIs	Berlin Traffic	Real-time sensor & historical traffic
Cloud	CapRover / Docker	Containerized deployment

Why MongoDB?
Our data is JSON-based with heavy geospatial components (GeoJSON). MongoDB‚Äôs flexibility, spatial indexing, and document model far surpass relational alternatives for our needs.
